### Hello, 👋

I'm Liz (she/her)—a [Maker](https://makers.tech/) and language agnostic full-stack developer. I've spent much of my career building and refining websites with brilliant web development teams for arts and design events. Now I am embarking on a new challenge as a software developer, where I can use some of my experience to help build great products myself. 

Find out more about my experience and aspirations over on my [GitHub CV](https://github.com/lookupdaily/CV) or scroll down to check-out some of my favourite projects. ✨

🌱  **I’m currently learning...** TypeScript and React  
🔭  **At the moment I'm working on...** [Taped-It](https://github.com/voice-notes) an app to share voice notes in Slack; and [lookupdaily.com](https://github.com/lookupdaily/website), a space dedicated to getting out, looking up and around  
🔍  **I'm interested in...** making useful, beautiful, and user-friendly products for all
